                                    <p class="card-text ">Although he thought that the best thing to do for the role would be to gain some weight, Todd Phillips, the director of the film, convinced him otherwise. He followed a strict diet that helped him lose almost 45 pounds.

                                    <p class="card-text ">The character’s laughter is charged with suffering and fear since it’s prompted by a condition related to epilepsy. Phoenix studied the behavior of people with this symptom thoroughly for months until he managed to
                                        perform the unique laugh perfectly.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text ">His acting career began in 1986 when he was 12 years old. Since then, he has appeared in movies such as SpaceCamp, Gladiator, Her, Walk the Line and many others.</p>

                                        The scar has accompanied him throughout his entire life.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text ">Joaquin’s family was vegan so he adopted that way of life from an early age. He’s currently working with organizations that protect animal rights and has also carried out campaigns in the past to raise awareness concerning
                                        animal abuse.</p>
